<!-- Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Ph.D. student in Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/). -->


I'm passionate about using machine learning to solve complex scientific puzzles, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact.

This passion was forged during my time at NielsenIQ, where I grew from a Data Scientist to a Manager. There, I learned firsthand how to build practical, data-driven solutions, leading projects that enhanced operational efficiency and delivered significant business value, including one that cut costs by $54K USD. 

To tackle even deeper challenges, I am now a Ph.D. candidate in the **Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST**, advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/). My research focuses on the intersection of Graph Representation Learning and its applications to biology, and I've been fortunate to publish my work in top-tier conferences like NeurIPS and ICML. 

My goal is to continue creating practical value by applying advanced ML to meaningful scientific problems.

My Core Research Interests:
* AI4Science - Biology 
* Graph Representation Learning 
* Recommender System
